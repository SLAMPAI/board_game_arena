2025-08-08 09:44:34,324 - simulate - INFO - Agent 0 (litellm_groq/llama3-8b-8192) chose action: 5 with reasoning: I want to place my X in a position that will give me the highest chance of winning. Since the opponent has already placed their O in the top-left corner, I will place my X in the center of the board to put pressure on their position and limit their options. This will also give me the opportunity to potentially create a winning line in the future.

By placing my X in position 0, I can block the potential win for O and also set up a potential win for myself. Additionally, this move will also put pressure on O to respond in a way that blocks my potential win.
