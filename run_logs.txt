2025-08-08 16:30:23,758 - simulate - INFO - Agent 0 (litellm_groq/llama3-8b-8192) chose action: 4 with reasoning: I choose to place my X in the center of the board, which is the most strategic position. This allows me to have the most options for my next move and puts pressure on my opponent to respond. Additionally, placing my X in the center gives me a good chance of winning the game if my opponent makes a mistake.

Since the opponent has already placed their O in the top-left corner, I will place my X in the center of the board to put pressure on their position and limit their options. This will also give me the opportunity to create a potential winning line in the future.
